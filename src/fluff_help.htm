<H2>Moving and Copying Files</H2>
<p>
There are four ways to move or copy files in Fluff:
<ol>
<li>Drag-and-Drop: select one or more files in the right-side file list window, 
then drag the item (or items) to a directory in the left-side tree view; a 
confirmation dialog will pop up and help the user copy, move, and/or cancel
 </li>
 <li>Right-Click: select one or more files in the right-side file list window, 
move the mouse pointer to the left hand tree view, right-click to pop up 
the context menu, select "move to here" or "copy to here"; 
 </li>
 <li>Copy / Paste: select one or more files in the right-side file list window, 
click on the "Copy" button or select "Copy" from the right-click context 
menu, select the destination directory in the left-side tree window, and 
finally click on the "Paste" button or right-click and select the "Paste" command.
 </li>
 <li>Move to Trash / Restore: select one or more files in the right-side 
 file list window, click on the "Trash" button and confirm "move to trash"; later, 
 navigate to trash window, select and right-click on item there, then choose 
 "restore from trash" to a have it return to the location it originally came from. </li>
</ol>
</p>

<a name="types"></a>
<h2>Managing Filetypes and Associations with Programs</h2>
<p>
There is an GUI editor for filetype recognition, available through the main 
right-click menu (right click on the bottom status line or over an inactive 
part of the upper button bar, then select "Filetypes"), or by clicking on the "Type" 
button in the File Properties dialog box.    
We recommend you use this editor to manage the 
descriptive names for filetypes and the filetype identification hints.  However, 
filetypes and hints may be edited directly (with care!) in the configuration file 
~/.config/fluff.conf.  Once a file type is known, the associated applications editor may 
be used to define which external programs can be used to interact with it.
</p>
<h4>Managing Filetypes and Hints</h4>
<p>
<b>Saving and Undo:</b> In the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog box, any changes 
you make only affect a temporary copy.  If you click on the "Undo changes" button before 
you close the dialog, the temporary copy will be reset to the master copy.  
However, if you close the dialog box after making changes, the changes will be transferred 
to the master copy and will immediately affect the file detail list display.  The 
changes will be made persistent (written to the .fluff.conf configuration 
file) if and when the Fluff application closes normally.  However, if Fluff is aborted or 
killed, the changes will not be updated in .fluff.conf and will be lost.
</p>
<p>
<b>Changing a Filetype's Name:</b> In the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog box, 
select any filetype identification hint that is for the filetype you want to rename, 
then simply edit the name in the "Filetype Name" input field.  As you edit, you will see
selected hint and any other hints for the same filetype automatically update.
</p>
<p>
<b>Modifying a Filetype Identification Hint:</b> In the "Manage File Types 
and Hints" dialog box, select the filetype identification hint you want 
to modify.  Below you will see checkboxes for the hint method, and input field  
for the distinct matching pattern string (the interpretation of which depends 
on the hint method), and (for header-based hint methods) an input field for 
byte offset in the file's header for the matching pattern.  Here is how the hint 
methods work: 
</p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Header string </td> 
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Fluff reads the initial file content, and tries to find the 
            specific "Matches" string pattern at the specified fixed offset
            from the start of the file (offset 0 = first byte of the file, 
            offset 1 is the second byte, etc.)<br></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Header bytes </td> 
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Fluff reads the initial file content, and tries to find the 
            specific "match" pattern of bytes at the specified fixed offset
            from the start of the file (offset 0 = first byte of the file, 
            offset 1 is the second byte, etc.).  The pattern of bytes 
            to look for are specied in the "Matches" input field as two-character
            hexadecimal numbers (e.g. 12 34 AB F3) delimited by spaces. <br></td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Filename Extension </td> 
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Fluff looks at the last n characters of a file's filename for a 
            match to the n-character string specified in the "Matches" 
            character pattern.  For this method, the "Offset within file" 
            field is not relevant and is disabled.<br></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
Changes to the hint properties will be immediately reflected in 
the hint list, but not committed to the master copy until the dialog box is 
closed.
</p>
<p>
<b>Adding a New Hint:</b> In the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog box, 
click on the the "Add new hint" button.  A new hint will be added to the list
with some generic properties, unless you have reached the built-in limit 
(200 hints).</p>
<p>
<b>Removing an existing Hint:</b> In the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog 
box, select the hint you want to remove, then click on the the "Remove 
hint" button.  If you selected the one and only hint for a certain filetype, 
Fluff will not allow you to remove it, otherwise, you should see the hint disappear.</p>
<p>
<b>Adding a New Filetype:</b> In the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog box, 
click on the the "Add type" button.  A new hint with generic properties and a 
generic name will be created and displayed in the interface.  The filetype 
name and identification hint properies may be adjustusted as described above. 
The new filetype will be transferred to the master copy and reflected in the 
file list window when the user closes the dialog box. Note: you may also 
create a new filetype for a file considered a generic file by using the 
"Type" button on the File Properties dialog box and supplying a filetype 
name.</p>
<p>
<b>Viewing or Changing the Associated Programs for a Filetype:</b> In the 
"Manage File Types and Hints" dialog box, click on the "Associated apps..." button.
The "Manage Associations" dialog box will open.  If invoked from this button, 
changes in the associations are not transferred to the master copy until 
the "Manage File Types and Hints" dialog is closed.  </p>
<p>Note: The generic file 
type is not listed in the types and hints list since it is default when no 
specific hint matches.  To add or modify an association for generic files, 
select any file in the file details list, invoke the right-click menu 
command "Open with..."  If the selected file is not a generic type, check 
the "Open with option for generic file" checkbox then click on the "More..."
button.  Now you may select an association definition to modify or delete, 
or add a new association.</p>

<h4>Managing Associations</h4>
<p>
<b>Saving and Undo:</b> In the "Manage Associations" dialog box, any changes 
you make only affect a temporary copy.  If you click on the "Undo changes" button before 
you close the dialog, the temporary copy will be reset to original copy.  
However, if you close the dialog box after making changes, the changes will be transferred 
to the original copy.  The 
changes will be made persistent (written to the .fluff.conf configuration 
file) if and when the Fluff application closes normally.  However, if Fluff is aborted or 
killed, the changes will not be updated in .fluff.conf and will be lost.
</p>
<p>
<b>Modifying a Filetype Association with a Program: </b> In the "Manage 
Associations" dialog box, select the association you want 
to modify.  Below you will see an input field for the "Action Label", which is 
used on the button bar and file window's right-click menu; and a command line, 
which tells Fluff how to run the associated program. In the command line, "%s" will 
be replaced with a copy of the selected filename or filenames, where each file is 
surrounded by double-quotes: "file1" "file3" (etc.). Your changes will be 
updated immediately in the association list.
</p>
<p>
<b>Adding a new Filetype Association with a Program: </b> In the "Manage 
Associations" dialog box, click on the "Add new" button. You will see a new 
association defined with generic properties.  Modify  the association you want 
to modify.  Below you will see an input field for the "Action Label", which is 
used on the button bar and file window's right-click menu; and a command line, 
which tells Fluff how to run the associated program.
</p>
<p>
<b>Removing a Filetype Association with a Program: </b> In the "Manage 
Associations" dialog box, select the association you want 
to delete.  Click on the "delete" button. You will see the 
association removed from the list immediately.
</p>
<p>
<b>Changing the Order of Associations: </b> Since the first two associations 
for a given filetype have a special status, you may want to adjust associations' 
order.  In the "Manage Associations" dialog box, select the association you want 
to reprioritize.  Click the "Up" and/or "Down" button to elevate or demote the file(s) 
priority relative to the others. You will see the changes in the order 
immediately, but not affect the main window until the dialog boxes are closed.
</p>

<H2>Special Configuration Options</H2>
<p>The Fluff configuration file is stored in ~/.config and is named fluff.conf.  
Here are a few settings that are not exposed in the GUI:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>TrashbinPath </td> 
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>Directory that Fluff will store items inserted into "trash." 
        In RAM-resident file managers, setting this to a non-volatile 
        directory (e.g. /tmp) will mean that the "trash bin" will be 
        automatically emptied each time the system shuts down.  If you 
        want a persistent trash bin, configure this to a directory that 
        is normally saved in non-volatile storage (i.e. /home/tc/.trash).<br>

You can expand or collapse sections of the tree view by clicking on the 
left-side column on the plus (+) or minus(-) characters, or by using the 
left and right cursor arrow keys.
</p>
<p>
To easily select multiple files, you may "sweep" over right-side file 
list using the normal left-click-and-drag gesture, but in the non-name 
columns.  As in several other file managers, you may also shift-click 
to extend a selection range, or ctrl-click to toggle the selection of 
individual files.  
</p>
<p>Fluff will try to utilize the window manager's color scheme and display 
something legible for reasonable combinations of foreground 
and background colors.  However, some combinations of colors will not be 
usable.  Fluff will utilize the window manager's FLTK window style 
setting, which can currently be one of "none" (Windows 95 style), "gtk+", 
or "plastic" (Mac OS Aqua style).</p>
<p>
Some filesystes for mountable media such as FAT32 USB memory sticks support
upper and lower case letters in filenames in a limited way, so the underlying 
Linux file management commands used by Fluff may not allow you to successfully
rename a file if the only difference is capitalization.  For 
example, if you try to rename myfile to MyFile on a USB Stick, it will 
not work for certain filesystem format types.  However, you 
may change the name in two steps: myfile --> myfile1, then myfile1 --> MyFile.
